Funtionalities:
I couldn't create the bot due to the difficulty and the way I designed my game. I underestimated the difficulty of making a bot, my idea seemed like it worked, but there were small bugs that made it difficult. I left some of the code I wanted to use. 



I added background music and the ability to switch the soundtrack. 

Bugs: 
Clicks might not register if on the edge of the button

Bot game doesn't work
